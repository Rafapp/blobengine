  <h1>Jelly Engine</h1>
  <h2>A 3D Game Engine that specializes in Soft Body Physics</h2>
</div>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Most (if not all) modern game engines are capable of simulating the behavior of physical bodies such as rigid bodies for realtime applications.</p>

<p>However their counterpart, soft bodies are not a feature available to developers out of the box or without the need to tinker and create custom solutions to solve for them for real-time rendering applications such as games and interactive applications.</p>

    <br>
    <p>It is for this reason that we decided to build <b>Jelly Engine</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Soft bodies are all around us in the physical world. Materials such as human skin, rubber balls or even jelly cubes behave in complex ways, which are typically hard to simulate and even more so at runtime while maintaining good performance in most customer devices. Applications of such technology could be used for, but not limited to:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Medicine: Training environments for surgery practicioners with high fidelity models of human organs and anatomy</li>
  <li>Engineering: Simulation and analysis of deformable materials like polymers and lattice structures</li>
  <li>Interactive applications: New game design mechanics involving deformable 3D objects, such as wrestling or bouncy castle games</li>
</ul>
